- Sentiment mining on Singapore attractions.
  &nbsp;

- Created a detailed **NLP** pipeline for sentiment classification and aspect based sentiment analysis (**ASBA**) on 195K+ reviews (extracted using **BeautifulSoup**) covering 20 popular attractions in Singapore.
  &nbsp;

- Designed an ensemble architecture using the **XgBoost** and Fine-tuned **BERT** for multi-class (5 classes) classification to get overall validation loss of 0.02.
  &nbsp;

- In addition, also examined the sentiments (positive, negative and neutral) for 120+ aspects covering 20 attractions using **Topic Modelling** based aspect mining and fine-tuned BERT to get more fine-grained insights.
  &nbsp;

- A **conversational chatbot** is also created for easy user interaction.
