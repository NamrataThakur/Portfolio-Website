- Designed a computer vision (**CV**) pipeline for Action Quality Assessment on 2K+ videos to predict the score for diving sequences.
  &nbsp;

- Created an ensemble architecture using deep-learning (number of twists, number of somersaults from **RepNet**) and hand-crafted features (angle of entry, splash size) to increase the interpretability factor of the output, derived through an **SVM Regressor** model with final R2 score of 0.8002.
  &nbsp;

- Led the architecture design by incorporating concepts like temporal segmentation using **2D CNN**, automatic scoring through **i3D**, and **optical flow** for splash size analysis.
